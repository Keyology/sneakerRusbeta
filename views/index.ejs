        <p class='infoparagraph'>
            SneakRus is a platform that takes the work out of selling sneakers.
            No more long conversations with customers about if you have a particular shoe in your stock, in your
            Instagram direct messages.
            Using SneakRus will save you time all you do is just upload the informationfor the product we do the rest
            the customers will always know what's in stock.
            The customer can buy from your store through our platform.
            SneakRus is a consumer one stop shop for all their needs.
            They will be able to buy, trade, and sell all through the platform at their chosen shop.
            I envision a place where anyone can become a part of this and get the gear that he or she couldn't get at
            the releases.
            SneakRus will handle most transactions and all you need to do is keep uploading and verifying sneakers and
            anything thing else as they come into your store.
